## Spring REST Health Care Domain Capstone â€“ WeCARE

WeCARE is an online Life Coaching application that helps its users to sign up and log in to seek the guidance of famous Life Coaches from different expertise in one place. Users can search for a Life Coach based on specialty and can book an appointment within 7 days. They can also see upcoming appointments and can reschedule or cancel the appointments, based on this a mailer is sent to their mail ids. Similarly, Life Coaches can also sign up and login and can see their upcoming schedule.

Below are the functionalities present in the application:

#### For User:

In this Capstone Project, I have to implement the backend using Spring REST. Database will be auto-generated after modifying properties file and on executing the application.
